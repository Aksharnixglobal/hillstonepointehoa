```css
:root {
  --brown: #5b4a3f;        /* Primary brand color */
  --muted: #8c7a6b;        /* Secondary text color */
  --bg: #f7f6f4;           /* Background color */
  --card: #ffffff;         /* Card/content background */
  --text: #222;            /* Primary text color */
  --accent: #8b6914;       /* Accent color for buttons */
}
```
